<hr>
<p>The hardest part of CIS 241 that it <i>constantly</i> felt like a learning experience where I was making breakthrough after breakthrough when building my own website for the final project. I felt I had learned so much from the labs, but it didn’t truly feel like it all clicked together until I started doing some of the requirements for the project. I was constantly referring to the examples given, and trying to learn what others did that was not only good enough to get a good score on the project, but so excellent both visually and in their code that they were featured for future classes, and I cannot state how much I appreciate being able to learn from their examples.</p> 
<p>This really reinforced my view that coding, while not always a “team sport” is always collaborative between coders as one person may figure out a solution that stumps someone else, and a third person may take that code sample that was shared and improve it to make it more efficient.</p>
