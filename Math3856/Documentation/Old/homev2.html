<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Hello visitor, and welcome to my webpage!</h2> <!--make sure to center this -->
<p>My name is Jared Math, and this is my project for CIS 241 demonstrating what I’ve learned, and telling you a bit about myself. I enjoy video games, specifically speedrunning, building models, reading, and putting together computers. I’m 26, and I have been working on a CIS ATA degree.</p>
<p>Before coming to Edmonds, I was in the Air Force, and was a 2A652, or an Aerospace Ground Equipment Journeyman. This entailed taking care of all the equipment that is used to start, test, power up, power down, and run diagnostics on aircraft including inspecting the equipment, and delivering it to the aircraft. Fittingly, the job motto was “No Air Power Without Ground Power,” which refers to one of the biggest aspects of the job, delivering generators that are almost universally used to do anything with the aircraft.</p>
<p>I came to Edmonds because I liked the programs, and had several friends already going here give it good recommendations. I currently am working on a CIS ATA, and I would also like to get more into Digital Forensics which really interested me. I also really enjoyed technical writing, and I would not mind attempting to get a job in either field.</p>
